# Pysnacks 1  

Tht PySnacks 1 virtual workshop is the first event of the IAA Severo Ochoa Training Initiative which consists on a series of workshops on 
the use of Python packages for astrophysics/space science called ”PySnacks”. 

PySnacks 1 consist of four sessions dedicated to fundamental packages (Pandas, Astropy, Astroquery) in combination with the Gaia and Pa-STARRS datasets which will take place on 22, 25, 29 March and 1 April 2022 from 10am to 1pm (CET), 

Session 1 - 22nd March 2022
1. Basic queries
2. Coordinate Transformations

Session 2 - 25th March 2022 
3. Plotting and Tabular Data
4. Plotting and Pandas
5. Transform and Select

Session 3 - 29th March 2022
6. Join
7. Photometry

Session 4 - 1st April 2022 
8. Visualization

The session materials are based on the Data Carpentry Astronomy Curriculum "Foundations of Astronomical Data Science *beta*" lesson (see https://datacarpentry.org/astronomy-python/), but modified to better tailor the IAA participant needs. 

This repository hosts the materials for the workshop and instructions on how to run the tutorials. It also contains a conda environment needed to execute the python notebooks, either locally or in a cloud platform.

# Execution of the tutorials

Tutorials execution will be on JupyterHub instances at IAA-CSIC. The virtual machines will be served by Jupyter Hub deployed on the host institution (IAA). You need to login to your dedicated machine and the Jupyter instance will be available for two weeks from the start of the workshop. Your progress will be stored and can be retrieved every time you access the service. You can use this service to experiment and work on your own files.
